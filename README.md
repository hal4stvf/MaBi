Mathematische Bildverarbeitung
==============================

## What happens here?

Providing the script based on a handwritten script.  
(Providing Lecture Notes either in Markdown or/and Latex.)

If you just interessted in the content of the lecture. Just visit 
regulary and download the latest pretty latexdocument **BiVa.pdf**.   
*Note*: I have to compile a **new** pdf for every change I make, so 
if you want to use this pdf to make (electronics) notes on it
I am not sure how this good be done in a need way.

#### Structure of this repository

- BiVa.tex: The *main* file where everything goes together. It is clean
and simple.
- Biva.sty: This is where all the needed latex packages and style commands 
are written down
- mathmacros.sty: similiar to Biva.sty but only for the mathematical
stuff. (It is originally from another *project*.)
- Chapters/\*.tex: There all the Chapters with the actuall latex *code*. 
-	figures/tikz\_pictures.sty: I put all the tikzpictures there with a
certain command. (See the files.) 

### Keeping uptodate

Just clone/fork this repository (ask me or google what that means). And pull 
whenever you want to be uptodate.  
**Note**: changes you did in this repository might get overwritten
without warning!

## The Code didn't change for days, even Weeks?

That means it either past march 2018 or you are on the wrong branch.
The branches I will push the newest changes is WorkInPorgress. 
I will also update the master branch when I know that a few people
checked the script for mistakes and readability.

## Why is there so much tabbing?

Well, I use a tabsize of "2" which makes the code look pretty in my editor.  
Please don't change tabs to whitespaces.

## My pdf is broken. I only see a lot of grids instead of pictures?

My first priority is to get the math done and right! So whenever there is a
sketch or picture I first will put this grid in and than later put in a
tikzpicture. Or maybe you want to do it? 

## Can I contribute?

Yes, please! Just make a pull request or become a contributor.
If you don't know what any of that means - just ask me.

## I found a mistake what should I do?

Please just edit the file (you can do it in the browser!) and make a pull request. If you are not sure if it is 
a mistake though you can of course just add an issue.

## What is github anyway?

Good Question! Just google though or ask me in person.

## How can I view Markdown and what is it?
[Check out wikipedia!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
[And this!](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
There is (probably) plenty of Software, e.g. there will be an 
Add on for your favorite browser to parse the TeX code.
